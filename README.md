# JavaLang
I made a "language" using java.

## How it works (explained badly)
- Reads in the file passed in the arguments
- Interperates each line ignoring the commented out lines
- Does operations, conditionial statements, input or output.

Language docs can be found [here](https://github.com/callums005/JavaLang/blob/master/Java%20Lang.docx)
